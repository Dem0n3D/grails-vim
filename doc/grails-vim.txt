*Grails-vim.txt*   Make your IDE-using friends jealous.

Introduction                                                            *Grails-vim*

What is Grails-Vim?

Grails-Vim is modeled after Tim Pope's Rails.vim. It provides navigation
shortcuts and cool testing features for Grails projects.

Even if you use an IDE most of the time, Grails-vim is handy when you don't
want to wait 10 minutes for your IDE to start or if you're on a machine with
less than 2 TB of memory.

Navigation mappings                                  *Grails-vim-Navigation-Mappings*

Currently, all Grails-vim mappings begin with <leader>g.  In the future this will be
configurable.

<leader>gd              Jump to current file's corresponding Domain Model
<leader>gc              Jump to current file's corresponding Controller
<leader>gv              Opens a Netrw screen with the views that correspond to the current file.
<leader>gs              Jump to corresponding Service (Ex: User.groovy -> UserService.groovy)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing mappings                                     *Grails-vim-Testing-Mappings*

Grails-vim has some handy features for jumping from tests to test-reports.  I find them
handier than looking at the HTML test reports that are created by Grails.

<leader>gg              Opens |quickfix-window| with a list of failed tests.  
                        Press <Enter> in the quickfix window to jump to the failed tests.
                        You can use Vim's built-in |quickfix| functionality for navigating tests.

<leader>gr              Jump to the text report for the current file.  For example, if you're in
                        UserTests.groovy, Grails-vim will jump to the output file for that test, where
                        you can see the details of the test output / errors and stack traces.

<leader>gt              Jump to the test for the current file.  For example, if you're in
                        User.groovy, you will jump to UserTests.groovy

<leader>gx              Jump to the XML test output for the current file.  XML
                        versions of the test reports are of course more structured, and can help with
                        debugging tests.
